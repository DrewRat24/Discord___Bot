"""You gem. You absolute masterpiece of God. You shining piece of gold. You are a piece of art, that the Angels drawn angels Earth,and forgot the paint brush. You have a freckle on your neck. Did you know that?
It's rather cute.

You are absolute,astoundingly gorgeous and that's the less interesting thing about you. You are Ethereal. A Heavenly Angel that God send down to Earth to put a smile in people in the worst days. You are so beautiful that you holy light cures depression itself. You are the pinnacle of perfection.

You are the most gorgeous person that i have ever seen. You hair is one of the most gorgeous that i've ever seen. And you smell like strawberrys.

You are always so happy and kind to people, it's like a big breath of fresh air when i walk into the street and see you! You haven't worn makeup all week? Damn, you're gorgeous! You carry yourself with much more maturity than most people on the Internet!

I love talking to you. You dress in a stunning way,and you look really nice every day. You look just like your mother,she was a beautiful human being.

Damn,that confidence looks really sexy on you! You think your beauty is on your considerably big breasts? Look up! I adore you. You are a real life Mona Lisa. You are the breathing,talking,living equivalent of a piece of art. I love seeing your smile,it brightens my day every time. I wish i could make you laught like that more often. You're beautiful all the time,but when you smile like that,i swear my world stops!

I cannot believe how incredibly smart you are. Amazingly smart. Beautifully smart. Q.I. of 100 smart. Higher than Einstein Q.I smart. Einstein would be envious os you. You could decyphre the secrets of the universe if you could,and you will one day.

You're that "nothing" when people ask me what i'm thinking about. You look great today. You're a smart cookie. I bet you make babies smile. You have impeccable manners. I like your style. You have the best laught.I aprecciate you. You are the most perfect you there is. Our system of inside jokes is so advanced that only you and i get it. And I like it. You light up the room. You should be proud of yourself. If cartoon bluebirds were real,they would be sitting on your shoulders singing with you right now. You're a great listener. I bet you sweat glitter. Jokes are funnier when you tell them. Your bellybutton is kind of adorable. You're irrestible when you blush. Babies and small animals probably love you. There's ordinary,and then there's you. You're someone's reason to smile. You're even better than a Unicorn,because
you're real. How do you keep so funny and making everyone laugh? Has anyone ever told you that you have a great posture? The way you treasure your loved ones is incredible. You're really something special,you're a gift to those around you.
